Q1.The best case is O(n). The worst case is O(n^2) because you have to half the number
of elements each time you sort creating 1/2n^2 iterations which simplifies to
O(n^2).

Q2. An in-order transversal has a time complexity of O(n) because each element of
the tree is checked.



1. Approximately 5 hours.
2. Difficult
3. Completely alone
4. 50%
5. I feel as though I understood the quick select algorithm in theory, but when
