1. 6 hours
2. difficult
3. I worked on this assignment alone
4. I understand the concepts but not how to implement them
5. I like that the lectures are posted online
6. I struggle with coding the assignments even with a good understanding of the
algorithms. I think sense the lecture are completely theory based the homework should
as well.
